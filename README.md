# Bitcoin Core with Falcon: Post-Quantum Security

ðŸ”’ This repository aims to enhance the security of Bitcoin Core by integrating the Falcon lattice-based digital signature algorithm into the Bitcoin Core. Falcon is designed to provide post-quantum security, safeguarding the Bitcoin network against potential quantum computing threats.

## About Falcon

Falcon is a cryptographic signature algorithm submitted to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Project. It is designed to resist attacks from quantum computers, making it a promising choice for securing Bitcoin transactions in a post-quantum era.

Key features of Falcon include:

- **Security**: Falcon is based on the theoretical framework of Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan for lattice-based signature schemes, providing robust security.
- **Compactness**: Falcon signatures are substantially shorter than many other lattice-based signature schemes, making them efficient for blockchain use.
- **Speed**: Implementation of fast Fourier sampling allows for rapid signature creation and verification.
- **Scalability**: Falcon offers efficient operations, allowing for long-term security parameters at a moderate cost.
- **RAM Economy**: Enhanced key generation in Falcon uses minimal RAM, making it compatible with memory-constrained devices.

## Performance

Falcon's performance on a common desktop computer is impressive:

- **Falcon-512**: Key generation time: 8.64 ms, Signature generation speed: 5948.1 signatures per second, Public key size: 897 bytes, Signature size: 666 bytes.
- **Falcon-1024**: Key generation time: 27.45 ms, Signature generation speed: 2913.0 signatures per second, Public key size: 1793 bytes, Signature size: 1280 bytes.

These performance metrics demonstrate Falcon's efficiency and suitability for real-world applications.

## Usage

This project includes two Python scripts, `main.py` and `testnet.py` in `Falcoin-Python` folder, for working with Bitcoin-related operations and cryptography. Below, you'll find short descriptions of each file, along with links to detailed explanations.

### `main.py`

[Detailed Explanation](#detailed-explanation-mainpy)

`main.py` is a Python script that demonstrates how to generate Bitcoin key pairs, create addresses, and perform digital signatures for transactions, using Falcon lattice-based cryptography.

### `testnet.py`

[Detailed Explanation](#detailed-explanation-testnetpy)

`testnet.py` is a Python script that showcases Bitcoin-related operations within the Bitcoin testnet environment. It covers key generation, UTXO retrieval, transaction signing, and broadcasting. This script is a valuable tool for simulating Bitcoin transactions without using real Bitcoin, using the Falcon generated key pairs and addresses.

## Detailed Explanation: `main.py`

### Overview

### Steps in the Code

1. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries for Bitcoin-related operations and cryptography.

2. **Generate Keys**: A function is defined to generate cryptographic key pairs and Bitcoin addresses.

3. **Generate Alice's Keys**: Generate key pairs and an address for Alice.

4. **Generate Bob's Keys**: Generate key pairs and an address for Bob.

5. **Message Signing**: A message is signed using Alice's secret key.

6. **Signature Verification**: Verify the signed message using Alice's public key.

## Detailed Explanation: `testnet.py`

### Overview

`testnet.py` is a Python script for simulating Bitcoin transactions within the Bitcoin testnet environment. It covers key pair generation, unspent transaction output retrieval, transaction signing, and broadcasting.

### Steps in the Code

1. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries for Bitcoin-related operations.

2. **Initialize Bitcoin Testnet**: Create a Bitcoin testnet instance.

3. **Define Alice's and Bob's Credentials**: Define cryptographic credentials for both Alice and Bob (hardcoded), generated by `main.py`

4. **Retrieve UTXOs**: Fetch the unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) associated with Bob's Bitcoin address on the testnet.

5. **Create and Sign Transaction**: Create a Bitcoin transaction from Bob to Alice and sign it using Bob's secret key.

6. **Serialize and Broadcast Transaction**: Serialize the transaction data and push it to the testnet. Print the signature and transaction result.
